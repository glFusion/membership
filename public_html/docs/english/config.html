      <h1>glFusion Membership Plugin Configuration</h1>
      <p>The Membership Plugin allows site users to become members and gain access to additional features. This requires the Shop plugin to be installed and working correctly.<p />

      <h2>Main Membership Options</h2>

      <dl id="desc_member_group">
        <dt>Current Member Group</dt>
        <dd>Select the glFusion group to which members will automatically be added as current members. This can be used to limit access to content, create lists, etc. As soon as a membership expires, the member will be removed from this group. Use this group to limit access to only current members.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_grace_days">
        <dt>Grace Period</dt>
        <dd>Enter the grace period for membership expirations. This is the number of days after a membership expires during which the member will still be able to access the additional features. Enter "0" to have the membership terminate immediately upon expiration.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_drop_days">
        <dt>Days after expiration when member will be dropped</dt>
        <dd>This is the number of days after expiration when a member's membership record will be considered "dropped" and will no longer be shown in the membership list. Enter &quot;-1&quot; to disable this feature, or zero to have memberships dropped upon expiration.<br /><br />
There is no automatic facility for deleting membership records completely from the database. If a membership is created in error it must be deleted manually.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_expires_eom">
        <dt>Round expiration up to end of month?</dt>
        <dd>Select whether to round the expiration date to the end of the month. For example, if a member joins on July 15, selecting "Yes" here will have their membership expire on July 31 of next year.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_early_renewal">
        <dt>Early Renewal</dt>
        <dd>This is the number of days prior to a membership's expiration when it may be renewed. You probably want to allow members to renew at least a few days before their memberships expire.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_notifydays">
        <dt>Expiration Notification Interval</dt>
        <dd>Enter a number of days to serve as the notification interval. Used with the Number of Notifications, this will be the &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;Send X notifications Y days apart.&quot;</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_notifycount">
          <dt>Number of notifications to send</dt>
          <dd>Enter the number of reminders to send of impending expiration. Example: if Notify Interval is &quot;30&quot; and &quot;2&quot; is entered here, notifications will be sent 60 days before expiration and again 30 days before.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_notifymethod">
        <dt>Method of expiration notifications</dt>
        <dd>Select how members should be notified that their membership is about to expire. The options are none, via email, via message at login, or both.</dd>

      <dl id="desc_period_start">
        <dt>Membership Period Start</dt>
        <dd>Select the starting month for memberships, or "Rolling" if memberships can be started at any time.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_disable_expired">
        <dt>Disable Expired Accounts?</dt>
        <dd>Select &quot;Yes&quot; if you wish to have members&apos; site accounts disabled when their membership expires. This option would be used if you operate a private site that only permits current members to log in. The account status will be set to &quot;Banned&quot;. Rember that the administrator must manually re-enable the account for members who wish to renew after expiration.</dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_require_app">
        <dt>Require App?</dt>

      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_app_provider">
          <dt>Application Provider</dt>
          <dd>Select the plugin to provide the application functionality if an application is optional or required.</dd>

          <dt>Application Form ID</dt>

    <li>Auto-Gen - Membership numbers will be created for new members according to the selected format (below). These numbers can be overridden by the administrator for each member.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <dl id="desc_mem_num_fmt">
        <dt>Membership Number Format</dt>
        <dd>Enter a format string (see &quot;sprintf() documentation&quot;) for the creation of membership numbers. The default &quot;%04d&quot; will create a 4-digit membership number equal to the user ID but you can add text or override this.<br />
        You may also create a function in lib-custom.php named &quot;CUSTOM_createMemberNumber($uid)&quot; which will receive the user&apos;s ID and return a string of your choice.
        </dd>
      </dl>

        <dt>Include current members?</dt>
        <dd>Select &quot;Yes&quot; to show current members on the profile list by default. This option may be combined with other options to show selected member types only.
